### What is Mespilus?

Mespilus is a sustainable and responsable buyer's cooperative, offering organic, local and artisanal foods, as well as health-related services, direct to the members and their families. We also develop programs necessary to improve information, education and the defense of consumers' and users' rights.

The cooperative was founded on the 10th of September, 2008 by a self-managed group of 36 members, dedidcated to direct participation. The cooperative's goal is to purchse highest-quality organic and local produce, with prices that are competitive with commercial groceries.
