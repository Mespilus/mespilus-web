### How are we organized?

#### Weekly Orders

To have a viable food cooperative, it is essential to bring fresh products and produce in on a weekly basis.

#### Order Preparation / Cleaning & Maintenance

To that end, members either take part in a group that distributes produce to the cooperative "baskets", or in groups that clean and maintain the space, based on a rotating schedule.

#### General Assembly

This is the managing body of the cooperative. There is an annual meeting, and quarterly focused gatherings. Attendance is required for all members.

#### Group "Energizers"

Monthly meetings held just after product pickup, where day-to-day issues are discussed or urgent issues are handled.

#### Work Groups

All members support the cooperative by taking part in one of the various work groups, based on knowledge and experience:

1. *Accounting and Administration*

    Manage financial accounting for the cooperative along with the sorresponding legal requirements.
    Maintain documentation and the member database.

2. *Billing*

    Prepare and process the weekly shopping bills accrued by the members.

3. *Purchasing*

    Keep the cooperative stocked with produce and handle weekly orders, according to criteria established by the members.
    Verify quality control over all purchased products.

4. *Intrastructure*

    Maintain and improve the cooperative's site and equipment.
    Organize recycling.

5. *Relacions externes*

    Promote sustainable and organic foods and practices outside of Mespilus
    Maintain relations with similar entities: Cooperatives, Ecological Fairs, etc.
    Coordinate our participation in social action movements.

6. *Comunicaci√≥*

    Manage and maintain the cooperative's digital infrastructure.
    Distribute current information and documentation to members and the public.
    Coordinate tasks for the cooperative's various working groups.
